Package pyprimes
================

This package includes functions for generating prime numbers, primality
testing, and factorising numbers into prime factors.


Definitions
-----------

"Prime numbers" are positive integers with no factors other than themselves
and 1. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...

"Composite numbers" are positive integers which do have factors other than
themselves and 1. Composite numbers can be uniquely factorised into the
product of two or more (possibly repeated) primes, e.g. 18 = 2*3*3.

Both 0 and 1 are neither prime nor composite.


Generating prime numbers
------------------------

To generate an unending stream of prime numbers, use the ``primes``
generator function:

    >>> p = primes()
    >>> [next(p) for _ in range(10)]
    [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]


The ``next_prime`` and ``prev_prime`` functions return the next, or
previous, prime from some given value:

    >>> next_prime(20)
    23
    >>> prev_prime(20)
    19

    NOTE:: For large prime numbers p, the average distance between p and
           the next (or previous) prime is proportional to ln(p).


Primality testing
-----------------

To test whether an integer is prime or not, use ``is_prime``:

    >>> is_prime(10)
    False
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True

For extremely large values ``is_prime`` may be probabilistic. That is,
if it reports a number is prime, it may be only *almost certainly* prime,
with a very small chance that the number is actually composite. (If it
returns False, the number is certainly composite.)

The ``trial_division`` function also returns True for primes and False for
non-primes, unlike ``is_prime`` it is an exact test. However, it may be
slow for large values.

    >>> trial_division(15)
    False
    >>> trial_division(17)
    True


Number theory convenience functions
-----------------------------------

There are a few convenience functions from the Number Theory branch of
mathematics.

    nprimes:
        Return the first n primes.

    nth_prime:
        Return the nth prime.

    prime_count:
        Return the number of primes less than n.

    prime_sum:
        Return the sum of primes less than n.

    prime_partial_sums:
        Yield the sums of primes less than n.


Sub-modules
-----------

The pyprimes package also includes the following sub-modules:

    awful:
        Simple but inefficient, slow or otherwise awful algorithms for
        generating primes and testing for primality.

    factor:
        Factorise numbers into the product of primes.

    probabilistic:
        Generate and test for primes using probabilistic methods.

    sieves:
        Generate prime numbers using sieving algorithms.

    utilities:
        Assorted utility functions.

plus the following semi-private sub-modules:

    compat23:
        Internal compatibility layer, to support multiple versions of
        Python.

    tests:
        Unit and regression tests for the package.

The contents of the semi-private modules are subject to change or removal
without notice.

    If ``start`` or ``end`` arguments are given, they must be integers.
    Only primes between ``start`` and ``end`` will be yielded:

    >>> list(primes(start=115, end=155))
    [127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151]

    ``start`` is inclusive, and ``end`` is exclusive:

    first prime yielded will be 2. If ``end`` is not given or is None,
    there is no upper limit.

    Optional argument ``strategy`` can be used to delegate to alternative
    implementations. If ``strategy`` is not given, or is None, a default
    implementation is used. Otherwise, ``strategy`` must be a function
    which takes no arguments and returns an iterator that yields primes.
    (A generator function is a convenient way to manage this.)

    The optional argument ``prover`` is used to specify alternative
    algorithms for checking primality. If ``prover`` is not given or
    is None, the default implementation is used. Otherwise, ``prover``
    must be a function which takes a single integer and returns a flag
    specifying whether the integer is prime or not, and ``is_prime``
    behaves as a thin wrapper around that function. No checks are made

    Any other value will raise TypeError or ValueError.

    With the default prover, ``is_prime`` may be probabilistic rather
    than deterministic for sufficiently large numbers. If that is the
    case, ``is_prime`` will give a ``MaybeComposite`` warning if ``n``
    is only probably prime rather than certainly prime. By default, the
    probability of a randomly choosen value being mistakenly identified
    as prime when it is actually composite (a false positive error) is
    less than 1e-18 (1 chance in a million million million).

    There are no false negative errors: if ``is_prime`` returns False,
